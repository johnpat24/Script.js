Var is also used to create variables but different to others because it has a global scoped which means if we create a code outside the function we can use it in any code but if we used function scoped or creating a variable inside a function it can only be used within that function. it  is also called the oldest keyword to declare in java script and can be declare function, locally and globally scoped the main different of var to the Let and conts is that the variable can be re-declare adn updated.

Let is now the preferred  syntax in creating a variable because it is an improvement or enhancement of var declaration but the Let has a block scope means they are defined inside a curly braces and they can be only accessed inside or within the block same with const that has a block scope the only difference is the Let variables is can be updated but not re-declare.

Const has a lot of similarities on Let but they also have some differences the tiny difference on it is that the const cannot be updated or re-declared.

In JavaScript we have called a boolean value and every value has a boolean equivalent like the word falsy value came from the word false same with the word truthy value that came from true. Ther are a six falsy values which include false, 0, ' ' or an empty, null, undefined and Nan or not a number. If you did not encounter the one of the six falsy values that will be considered as truthy values

0 - the number 0 is considered falsy because it  has no value which represents that nothingness which can automatically interpret as falsy

NaN - when it is converted in boolean it will always return false cause it represents the result of undefined

False - the word falsy is a boolean value of false
